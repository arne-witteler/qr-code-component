# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). It's a simple card layout that includes a QR code, heading, and descriptive text â€“ great for practicing layout and typography with HTML & CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual alignment and spacing based on a provided design

### What I learned

This project helped me refresh the fundamentals of responsive layout with Flexbox. I also practiced:

- How to center elements both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox
- Using `box-sizing: border-box` to manage layout more predictably
- Applying mobile-first thinking (e.g. with `max-width` and `vw` units)
- Improving visual hierarchy with font weights and spacing

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
